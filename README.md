#String Compression

Language used : C++

Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.

Example:
If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.

Sample Input :

aabbcdaa

Sample Output :

a2b2cda2
