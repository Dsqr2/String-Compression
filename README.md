String Compression in C++

Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.

Example:
If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".
The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.

Sample Input 1:
aabbcdaa
Sample Output 1:
a2b2cda2
